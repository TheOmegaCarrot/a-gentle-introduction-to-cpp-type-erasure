# Section 2: External Polymorphism

External polymorphism allows the injection of a class into an inheritance tree without actually modifying the class.

This is done by creating a thin wrapper class. See `external_polymorphism.cpp` to see this in action, and the mechanics more fully explained.

In this example, as with all future examples, I will place any code that you don't own in `namespace lib`.
